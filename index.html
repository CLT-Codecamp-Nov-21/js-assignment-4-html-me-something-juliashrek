            <h2>Buffalo, NY</h2>
            <p>Buffalo is the second largest city in the state of New York. Located at the eastern end of Lake Erie, at the head of the Niagara River, and next to the Canadian border with Southern Ontario. Known as The City of Good Neighbors, Buffalo is a place with perfect weather year round if you don't mind below freezing temperatures and a lot of snow. Home of the Buffalo Bandits lacrosse team, the Buffalo Bisons minor league baseball team, the Buffalo Sabres hockey team, and America's real football team, the Buffalo Bills. The birthplace of chicken wings and a community of people that jump through tables in 10 degree weather but also regularly donate thousands of dollars to charities they care about. This is the Bills Mafia. </p>

            <h2>4 Years of Heartbreak</h2>
            <p>The Buffalo Bills football team was founded in 1960 as a part of the American Football Conference (AFC) East Divison. They are also the only New York team that actually plays in the state of New York. After joining the NFL, they became perennial postseason contenders during the late 1980s and 1990s. Their greatest success occurred between 1990 and 1993 when they appeared in a record four consecutive Super Bowls. An accomplishment often overshadowed by them losing each game. The Bills played in their first Super Bowl in 1991, in Super Bowl XXV, and lost 20-19 against the New York Giants. They needed a field goal to win in the final seconds of the game. Bills kicker, Scott Norwood attempted a 47-yard field goal. The words "wide right" still haunt the city of Buffalo to this day. They played in Super Bowl XXVI in 1992, losing 37-24 against the Washington Redskins. In 1993, at Super Bowl XXVII, the Bills lost 52-17 to the Dallas Cowboys. The Bills become the first team in NFL history to lose three consecutive Super Bowls. Once again, the country was stunned when the Buffalo Bills were back for another run at the Super Bowl in 1994. A rematch against the Dallas Cowboys for Super Bowl XXVIII. They lost 30-13.</p>

            <h2>The Drought</h2>
            <p>The Buffalo Bills' playoff drought nearly became old enough to vote before one of the most miraculous evenings of football that sent the team to the playoffs for the first time since 1999, ending the longest postseason drought in American professional sports. It all starts with the game against the Tennessee Titans, known as the Music City Miracle, but everyone in Buffalo knows it was an illegal Forward Pass. The Titans won 22-16 over the Bills in the wild-card round of the playoffs. In the offseason of this year, the New England Patriots drafted Michigan quarterback, Tom Brady in the sixth round, 199th overall. This man would go on to dominate the AFC East for 20 years. The Bills went through 12 quarterbacks in 17 years without making it to the playoffs even once. Owner Ralph Wilson Jr. died at 95 in 2014 with the city fearing that the team would be relocated. The owner of the Buffalo Sabres, Terry Pegula buys the Bills. His winning bid beat out a Toronto-based group fronted by rocker Jon Bon Jovi and a bid from former president Donald Trump. Really makes you think about how the different the world would be now if Terry didn't buy the team... Tom Brady and the New England Patriots have won six Super Bowl titles in the time that the Bills never even made it to the playoffs. But on January 11, 2017 the Bills hired the Carolina Panthers defensive coordinator Sean McDermott as head coach. The following season, on December 31, 2017, the Bills beat the Dolphins in Week 17 to finish 9-7. And they got the help they needed to make the playoffs when the Cincinatti Bengals quarterback, Andy Dalton threw a touchdown pass to beat the Baltimore Ravens, sending the Bills to the playoffs for the first time in almost exactly 18 years. They lost in the first round to the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they will return.</p>

            <h2>Our Lord and Savior: Josh Allen</h2>
            <p>Joshua Patrick Allen was born on May 21, 1996 in Firebaugh, California. He played college football at Wyoming, where he was a bowl game MVP. He was selected by the Buffalo Bills seventh overall in the 2018 NFL Draft. After inconsistent play during his first two years in the league, Josh had a breakout season in 2020 when he led the Bills to their first division title and playoff victory since 1995. He set the Bills franchise records for passing yards and touchdowns in a season while earning Pro Bowl and second team All-Pro honors. Joshn Allen was in the same draft class as Sam Darnold, Lamar Jackson, Josh Rosen, and Baker Mayfield. Everyone thought that Josh Allen was a terrible pick. A lot of Bills fans were disappointed that the Bills didn't pick someone else. He signed a four-year deal in 2018, beginning his NFL career as a backup. He made his first regular season appearance after starter Nathan Peterman was benched after posting a 0.0 passer rating. Josh became the starter for several weeks until an elbow injury. He returned and had several great games. He became the first quarterback in NFL history with at least 95 yards rushing in a three-week span. He was the AFC Offensive Player of the Week in Week 17. The Bills finished 6-10 this season. Josh led all quarterbacks with eight rushing touchdowns on the season.The following year led to more career highs for Josh Allen. The Bills lost in the AFC Wild Crad round against the Houston Texans, losing out on another run at the Super Bowl. In the 2020 season, Josh became the first Bills quarterback to pass for 300 yards in back-to-back games since Drew Bledsoe in 2002. Through the first four weeks, Josh joined Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, and Patrick Mahomes as the only four quarterbacks in NFL history with at least 700 yards passing, six touchdowns and no interceptions through the first two weeks of a season. Josh Allen helped the Bills clinch their first AFC East division title since 1995. He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week four times this year. The Bills won their first playoff game since 1995 against the Indianapolis Colts. The following week, the team would win their Divisonal round playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens. The Bills then lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship. In May 2021, the Bills signed Josh to a six-year contract extension. This year the Bills record is currently 11-6. Josh finished the regular season with a new career high 409 pass completions, 36 passing touchdowns, 763 rushing yards and six touchdowns on the ground. The Bills won the AFC East division title for the second consecutive season. Josh Allen and the Bills played a perfect game of football in the Wild Card Playoff game. They laid an absolute smackdown on the New England Patriots, winning 47-17, making history with zero punts, zero field goals, zero turnovers and zero fourthdowns.  </p>

            <h2>The Bills Mafia</h2>
            <p>It all began in November 2010 when Bills player, Stevie Johnson dropped a game winning pass that led to an overtime loss against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Johnson took to Twitter blaming God, "I PRAISE YOU 24/7!!!!!! AND THIS IS HOW YOU DO ME!!!!! YOU EXPECT ME TO LEARN FROM THIS??? HOW???!!! ILL NEVER FORGET THIS!! EVER!!! THX THO..." And the internet went wild. Adam Schefter of ESPN retweeted Johnson's tweet a day later, and Bills fans pounced on him. Many people were tweeting at Schefter calling him out for bringing the tweet back up. He blocked several people, one of whom @leslieanne94, then started the hashtag #BillsMafia. It blew up on Twitter, becoming a movement that fans all over the world and players use to describe the supporters of the Buffalo Bills. Fans created a logo and registered the domain. You can purchase official merchandise that helps support the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and many other charities in Buffalo, NY. There is no shortage of fan gear proudly supporting the Bills with teh Bills Mafia tagline. There are plenty of videos with crazed fans jumping off of buses through a folding table with the hashtag Bills Mafia. The fanbase may seem insane and drunk and stupid, but there a lot of incredible people part of this group. When Andy Dalton threw the game winning touchdown in 2017 to send the Bills to the playoffs for the first time in 17 years, Bills fans immediately started donating to The Dalton Foundation. Nearly $100,000 was donated to the charity that helps sick and physically challenged children and their families. When the Bills beat the Ravens to advance to their first AFC Championship game, Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson got a concussion during the game. Over 5,500 Bills fans donated more than $150,000 to Lamar's favorite charity, the Louisville chapter of Blessings in a Backpack, an organization that works to feed elementary school children in need on weekends. Josh Allen's grandmother passed away the night before a game in 2021. Josh had the opportunity to sit out this game, but he insisted on playing and threw for 415 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Bills to a 44-34 victory. Bills fans lead a massive fundraising effort to the John R. Oishei Children's Hospital in Buffalo in his grandmother, Patricia's name. Fans donated in $17 increments, the same jersey number Josh wears. Donations surpassed $1 million and the hospital unveiled the "Patricia Allen Pediatric Recovery Wing". The Bills Mafia may be well known for it's tailgates and suffering through terrible football for nearly two decades but this fanbase cares deeply about helping others. The Bills Mafia website is considered a movement that was created by fans and embraced by players. The Bills Mafia is more than just fans of the Bills, it is a family.</p>
